# Memory-Controller

Project Overview: <br>
This project implements Memory Controller designed to manage memory operations for an 4-bit word length with 8 bit row and column addresses. The controller efficiently handles read and write operations, ensuring reliable data transfer between the processor and memory.

Features: <br>
8-bit Word Length: Supports 8-bit data transactions.<br>
Memory Addressing: Capable of addressing and managing memory locations efficiently.<br>
Read/Write Control: Provides control signals for read and write operations.<br>

USAGE: <br>
Memory Management: Ideal for managing small-scale memory systems in embedded applications.<br>
Data Handling: Ensures accurate and efficient data transfer between CPU and memory.<br>
